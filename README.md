But, you can only get chappies breeded from other players.
Each chappy can only breed one or two times.
All Chappies play in the same gameworld.


#### Commands

- $cpy.start <breeded_chappy> <offered_credits>
- $cpy.breed <other_chappy> <offered_credits>
- $cpy.buy <other_chappy> <offered_credits>
- $cpy.reset

And you can interact with your chappy by sending it a private message.
Example: `Chappy: Let us play a round of blackjack.`
If your chappy is in good shape, chances for a better genome raise.
